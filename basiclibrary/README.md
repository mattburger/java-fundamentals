# Lab 2
## Description
This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java. Arrays in Java have a fixed size. Arrays are created with a certain size and they never shrink or grow. Java arrays are typed. You can have an array of integers, or an array of strings, but not an array mixed with integers and strings.

- Analyzing Weather Data
Use the October Seattle weather data above. Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.
